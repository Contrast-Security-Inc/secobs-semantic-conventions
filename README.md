# Security Observability Semantic Conventions 

Contrast builds its observability on top of open telemetry and thus we add to the semantic
conventions of otel.  This repo contains markup of the semantic convention definition for 
Contrast items.  It is in the same format as the normal otel semantic conventions and
we use the same otel tools to process our semantic convention data.

Semantic Conventions for Security Observability. 
The model definitions use a syntax defined at
[Semantic Convention YAML Language](https://github.com/open-telemetry/build-tools/blob/main/semantic-conventions/syntax.md)
