      - id: mechanism
        brief: >
          An authentication mechanism is a specific method or approach used to
          verify the identity of a user, system, or entity attempting to access a resource.
        examples:
          [password, token, biometric]
        type:
          allow_custom_values: false
          members:
            - id: password

      - id: protocol
        brief: >
          An authentication protocol is a set of rules and procedures that
          dictate how authentication mechanisms should operate to establish
          trust and verify identities securely.
        examples:
          [oauth, saml, ldap, custom]
        type:
          allow_custom_values: false
          members:
