# Semantic Conventions for Action Metrics

Actions occur within the context of an Web Application.

## HTTP Server

Applications that are served from an HTTP server.

### Metric: `http.server.action.total`

This metric is required.

<!-- semconv metric.http.server.action.total(metric_table) -->
| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `http.server.action.total` | Counter | `{action}` | A counter of actions for contrast |
<!-- endsemconv -->

<!-- semconv metric.http.server.action.total(full) -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Requirement Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | string | The type of action that was observed. | `file-open-create`; `authn-request` | Required |
| `http.request.method` | string | HTTP request method. [1] | `GET`; `POST`; `HEAD` | Recommended |
| `http.route` | string | The matched route (path template in the format used by the respective server framework). See note below [2] | `/users/:userID?`; `{controller}/{action}/{id?}` | Recommended |

**[1]:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

**[2]:** MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

`action` MUST be one of the following:

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `storage-query` | Functions that execute queries |
| `file-open-create` | file open or create action |
| `url-forward` | Any function designed to forward a request to another URL |
| `url-redirect` | Function that result in an http 302 redirect code sent to the client |
| `host-cmd-exec` | system shell command execution |
| `ldap-query` | Functions that result in and ldap query operation |
| `smtp-exec` | Functions that result in an SMTP command execution |
| `outbound-service-call` | Functions that result in external calls to other services |
| `authn-request` | Functions that perform authentication actions |
| `authz-request` | Functions that perform authorization actions |
| `el-execution` | Spring expression language execution |
| `ognl-execution` | Object-Graph Navigation Language expression execution. |

`http.request.method` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used, otherwise a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `CONNECT` | CONNECT method. |
| `DELETE` | DELETE method. |
| `GET` | GET method. |
| `HEAD` | HEAD method. |
| `OPTIONS` | OPTIONS method. |
| `PATCH` | PATCH method. |
| `POST` | POST method. |
| `PUT` | PUT method. |
| `TRACE` | TRACE method. |
| `_OTHER` | Any HTTP method that the instrumentation has no prior knowledge of. |

### Metric: `http.server.request.duration`

This metric is required.

The documentation for this metric is duplicated from the OTEL Semantic Convention
[http metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.22.0/docs/http/http-metrics.md#metric-httpserverrequestduration) document.
It is replicated here for convenience to the readers and to note that it is a required metric for agents to capture.

This metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.26.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advice)
of `[ 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 ]`.

<!-- semconv metric.http.server.request.duration(metric_table) -->
| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `http.server.request.duration` | Histogram | `s` | Duration of HTTP server requests. |
<!-- endsemconv -->

<!-- semconv metric.http.server.request.duration(full) -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Requirement Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `error.type` | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [1] | `timeout`; `name_resolution_error`; `500` | Conditionally Required: If request has ended with an error. |
| `http.request.method` | string | HTTP request method. [2] | `GET`; `POST`; `HEAD` | Required |
| `http.response.status_code` | int | [HTTP response status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6). | `200` | Conditionally Required: If and only if one was received/sent. |
| `http.route` | string | The matched route (path template in the format used by the respective server framework). See note below [3] | `/users/:userID?`; `{controller}/{action}/{id?}` | Conditionally Required: If and only if it's available |
| [`network.protocol.name`](../general/attributes.md) | string | [OSI application layer](https://osi-model.com/application-layer/) or non-OSI equivalent. [4] | `http`; `spdy` | Recommended: if not default (`http`). |
| [`network.protocol.version`](../general/attributes.md) | string | Version of the protocol specified in `network.protocol.name`. [5] | `1.0`; `1.1`; `2`; `3` | Recommended |
| [`server.address`](../general/attributes.md) | string | Name of the local HTTP server that received the request. [6] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | Opt-In |
| [`server.port`](../general/attributes.md) | int | Port of the local HTTP server that received the request. [7] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | Opt-In |
| `url.scheme` | string | The [URI scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.1) component identifying the used protocol. | `http`; `https` | Required |

**[1]:** If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type or a component-specific low cardinality error code.

If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
`error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error code.

The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
additional filters are applied.

If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

**[2]:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

**[3]:** MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

**[4]:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[5]:** `network.protocol.version` refers to the version of the protocol used and might be different from the protocol client's version. If the HTTP client used has a version of `0.27.2`, but sends HTTP version `1.1`, this attribute should be set to `1.1`.

**[6]:** See [Setting `server.address` and `server.port` attributes](/docs/http/http-spans.md#setting-serveraddress-and-serverport-attributes).
> **Warning**
> Since this attribute is based on HTTP headers, opting in to it may allow an attacker
> to trigger cardinality limits, degrading the usefulness of the metric.

|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation does not define a custom value for it. |

`http.request.method` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used, otherwise a custom value MAY be used.
